As we can see that for both classifcation and Regression Ensemble techniques performeed way better in case of classification the accuracy we got for ensemble techniques is of 99% while for regression also the results are excellent but to improve the result in case of regression we can apply Hyperparameter Tuning or optimization techniques like RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchSearchCV to improve the result more.
